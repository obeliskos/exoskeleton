    <h3>Webservice Example</h3>

    <p><i>This is an example webpage to demonstrate exoskeleton web services.  Web services must be enabled 
    within your settings file and the extension/suffix can be modified there as well.  For this example,
    we will leave the 'WebServerServicesExtention' set to '.svc'.</i></p>

    <p>Webservices (in exoskeleton) are mostly useful for communicating and exchanging data with other
    external applications.  You would not need to use web services to communicate within exoskeleton as 
    the 'client' pages are hosted within exoskeleton and can do everything the service implementation could.
    </p>

    <p>
        This example will allow you to launch a client test web page within an external browser.  That page
        will communicate with this exoskeleton program which is configured to implement two web services :
        <ul>
            <li>GetContactList.svc</li>
            <li>GetContact.svc</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
